⚡ **Fun Fact**:  
I don’t just break apps; I make them stronger! When I'm not deep in the testing zone, you'll probably find me nerding out on AI, reading about the latest tech trends, or strategizing my next chess move. 🧙‍♂️⚔️ (Spoiler: It's always the knight!)

🚀 **Pro Tip**:  
Automating testing is like playing chess. The goal isn't just to win but to *outsmart* every move your opponent (the bug!) makes.
